    "#### Prepare an access key on MinIO\n",
    "This virtual lab uses MinIO to upload the data that will be analyzed and store the results of the workflow. You can log into MinIO at https://scruffy.lab.uvalight.net:9001 using the same credentials as you're using to log into NaaVRE. In order to store and retrieve data from MinIO, you will need an access key. Create an access key [in MinIO](https://scruffy.lab.uvalight.net:9001/access-keys). Make sure to store the access key and secret key.\n",

    "You can adapt the workflow in NaaVRE to suit your own research objectives. To do this, copy the content of _Virtual Labs -> Biodiversity Time Series Analyses -> Git public_ to  _Virtual Labs -> Biodiversity Time Series Analyses -> My data_, or fork and clone the [git repository](https://github.com/QCDIS/Biodiversity_time_series_analyses_from_European_marine_ecosystems) to _My data_. \n",

    "To adapt the workflow, change the source code available in this virtual lab: [codebase/Data_cleaning_analysis....ipynb](../codebase/Data_cleaning_analysis_Example-Carlos-Cano-Barbacil.ipynb). After changing the source code you can recontainerize the Jupyter Notebook cell and update the adapted workflow node in  [workflows/biodiversity_time_series_analyses.naavrewf](../workflows/Biodiversity_time_series_analyses.naavrewf). For documentation how on to make these changes, go to https://naavre.net/docs/tutorials/#from-notebook-to-workflow. "
