You can log into MinIO at https://scruffy.lab.uvalight.net:9001 using the same credentials as you're using to log into NaaVRE. In order to store and retrieve data from MinIO, you will need an access key. Create an access key [in MinIO](https://scruffy.lab.uvalight.net:9001/access-keys). Make sure to store the access key and secret key. \n",
