    "You can adapt the workflow in NaaVRE to suit your own research objectives. To do this, copy the content of _Virtual Labs -> Biodiversity Time Series Analyses -> Git public_ to  _Virtual Labs -> Biodiversity Time Series Analyses -> My data_, or fork and clone the [git repository](https://github.com/QCDIS/Biodiversity_time_series_analyses_from_European_marine_ecosystems) to _My data_. \n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt the workflow, change the source code available in this virtual lab: [codebase/Data_cleaning_analysis....ipynb](../codebase/Data_cleaning_analysis_Example_1_03.ipynb). After changing the source code you can recontainerize the Jupyter Notebook cell and update the adapted workflow node in  [workflows/biodiversity_time_series_analyses.naavrewf](../workflows/Biodiversity_time_series_analyses.naavrewf). For documentation how on to make these changes, go to https://naavre.net/docs/tutorials/#from-notebook-to-workflow. "
