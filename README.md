A tutorial is available in [documentation/BioTiSAn_EuroMarEc_tutorial.ipynb](./documentation/BioTiSAn_EuroMarEc_tutorial.ipynb).

The workflow is in [workflows/Biodiversity_time_series_analyser.naavrewf](./workflows/Biodiversity_time_series_analyser.naavrewf). See the tutorial for instructions.

## Plots
These plots produced by the workflow show the frequency distribution of the time series along a "percentage of change" axis.  
Zero means that the ecological metric did not change, -100 means that it decreased from its initial level to zero and +100 that it doubled from its initial level.  
The more sites included in the analysis, the more sense makes to plot the frequency distribution.  
There is the possibility of plotting all the variables together and of changing the axis size to better observe the results, but this is heavily case dependent.
